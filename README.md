# Modelling species-habitat relationships across scales for nature conservation
### Dr. Elina Takola, June 2025

This repository contains the course material for the students (BSc &amp; MSc) of the course Animal Ecology in the University of Halle. The course will take place from Monday 16th of June to Thursday 19th of June 2025, from 09:15-12:00 in the Institute of Zoology in Halle. 
This course aims to introduce participants to the theory and practice of modelling species-habitat relationships, with an emphasis on spatial and ecological scales relevant to conservation planning. We’ll explore how species interact with their environments, how these relationships vary across scales, and how such knowledge can be applied to real-world conservation problems.

## Course outline 
Day 1 – Counting living things
Day 2 – A day in the life of a field ecologist
Day 3 – Solving ecological puzzles
Day 4 – Cross-scale dynamics in Ecology
