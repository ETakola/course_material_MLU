# Modelling species-habitat relationships across scales for nature conservation

This is the course material for the students (BSc &amp; MSc) of the course Animal Ecology in the University of Halle. The course will take place from Monday 16th of June to Thursday 19th of June 2025, from 09:15-12:00 in the Institute of Zoology in Halle. 
This course aims to introduce participants to the theory and practice of modelling species-habitat relationships, with an emphasis on spatial and ecological scales relevant to conservation planning. Weâ€™ll explore how species interact with their environments, how these relationships vary across scales, and how such knowledge can be applied to real-world conservation problems.
